# CAPA
Corrective Action, Preventive Action

This repository serves as a centralized log of Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPA) taken in response to outages, performance degradations, or operational issues across our infrastructure.

⚙️ What Qualifies as a CAPA

To maintain consistency and focus, this repository only logs incidents that meet our internal CAPA criteria — events that materially impact availability, reliability, or productivity.

# Category 1: Customer-Facing Failures
- Incidents where customers or end users cannot access key functionality, including (but not limited to):
- Contact form submissions not working
- Donate button or payment flow errors
- Primary site downtime or major content delivery failures
- Any issue that prevents a customer from successfully interacting with us

# Category 2: Development & Productivity Failures
- Incidents where internal teams experience sustained disruption to development workflows, such as:
- Broken or blocked development branches
- Failed or inconsistent builds across environments
- CI/CD failures that halt deployments
- Major tooling or infrastructure downtime impacting delivery velocity

# Eligibility & Ownership Rules
Items are added to this repository only when the specific team collectively agrees that:

- The issue cannot be resolved within the team's activites and
- The incident warrants postmortem documentation and preventive action.

CAPA entries may only be created or approved by Executive Team members.
